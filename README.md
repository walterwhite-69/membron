## Membron
A non destuctive virus inspired by memz

## Overview
Membron is a non-destructive virus created using Python. Unlike traditional viruses, Membron doesn't harm or corrupt files but rather demonstrates the potential vulnerabilities in computer systems. This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. It's important to note that deploying Membron on systems without proper authorization is illegal and unethical.

## Features
Non-Destructive: Membron doesn't delete or corrupt files. Instead, it showcases how vulnerabilities can be exploited.
Educational: Intended for educational purposes to understand how viruses work and to develop defenses against them.
Demonstrative: Membron illustrates how seemingly harmless code can be manipulated to perform malicious actions.

## Warning
Even its non destructive its still going to cause a BSOD(Blue Screen Of Death). So make sure to use virtual machine 

## Note
There is a class called MBR. Basically it should override your MBR(Master Boot Record). But I removed it since its a non destructive virus.
Your PC wont able to boot up again if i had add the MBR replace code

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and research purposes only. Deploying Membron on systems without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. The creator of Membron holds no responsibility for any misuse of this software.
